# 3D in HTML

![image](/image.png)

3D in HTML is a web app that allows users to explore and interact with 3D experiences powered by the aframe library. Users can publish their own aframe code for anyone to view it on the site. People can also copy the aframe code to use in their own projects. The web app is meant to be community driven, allowing users to share their 3D websites with others.

Note: 3D in HTML is still in its beta version. However, this version still allows users to view and publish aframe code!
